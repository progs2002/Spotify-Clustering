# SpotifyGenreClustering

An ongoing effort to leverage the Spotify API and perform various kinds of tasks like - 
* gathering the user's top tracks and artists
* creating a playlist of top tracks 
* getting all liked songs, creating feature vectors and clustering them in 3d (using t-SNE and k-means)
